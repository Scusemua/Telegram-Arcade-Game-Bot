# Included Games

As of right now, there are two games offered by the Telegram Arcade Bot.

## üé® Color Clicker

A simple Telegram-compatible HTML5 game where users must quickly click the rectangle that is correctly labeled with its color. Built using Python, Flask, and the Telegram Bot API.

### üß† Gameplay

- Two colored rectangles are shown.
- One is labeled correctly; the other is not.
- Click the correct one **before time runs out** to score a point!
- A wrong click or timeout ends the game.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Speed Words

You are shown a string of characters. You must quickly type an English word that contains those characters before the timer expires.

### üß† Gameplay

- Given a sequence of letters, enter an English word containing those letters
- You cannot re-use the same word multiple times (even for different sequences of characters)
- You are awarded additional time for each correct word
- You can increase the amount of time you are awarded by:
  - Increasing your streak (i.e., the number of consecutive, valid submissions)
  - Submitting longer words 
  - Surviving longer (the more correct submissions, the more time you get back -- and the faster the timer decreases)
